**Ecliptic** - The path the sun takes through the sky over the course of a year.

### Local Sky

![alt text](image-1.png)

- **Zenith** - The point directly above you.
- **Horizon** - All points 90 degrees away from the zenith.
- **Meridian** - The line that goes from the north point on the horizon, through the zenith, to the south point on the horizon.
- **Azimuth** - The angle along the horizon.

**Altitude** and **Direction** are used to describe the position of an object in the local sky.

### Coordinates

#### Earth

- **Latitude** - North or south from the equator
- **Longitude** - East or west from the prime meridian

#### Star

![alt text](image-2.png)

- **Declination** - North or south
- **Right Ascension** - East or west

## History of Astronomy

### The Greeks

**Geocentric Model** : The Earth is at the center of the universe and the planets move in circles around it

Noticed a period of **retrograde motion** in the sky

- **Retrograde Motion** : The apparent motion of a planet in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system as observed from a particular vantage point
- Planets usually move from West to East relative to the stars. However, they sometimes appear to move from East to West for a short period of time.
- Plato and Aristotle believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe

![Alt text](image-11.png)

#### Ptolemy (100-170 AD)

- Created a model (Ptolemaic Model) that explained retrograde motion using **epicycles**
- **Epicycles** : Small circles that planets move in as they orbit the Earth

#### Aristarchus (310-230 BC)

- First to propose a **heliocentric model** (Sun at the center of the universe)
- He noticed that the stars are much farther away than the Sun

### The Middle Ages

- The Church was the main authority

#### Copernicus (1473-1543)

- Proposed a heliocentric model
- He was the first to use the term "revolution" to describe the Earth's motion around the Sun

### The Renaissance

#### Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)

- Made the most accurate measurements of the positions of the stars and planets
- Showed that geocentric and heliocentric models were both incorrect through his observations
- Would lead to Kepler's Laws

#### Kepler (1571-1630)

- Used Brahe's data to come up with his laws (see above)

### The Scientific Revolution

#### Galileo (1564-1642)

- Used a telescope to observe the sky
- Discovered the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and sunspots
- The only way for the phases of Venus to occur as he observed was if it was orbiting the Sun
- After it was essentially proven that the Earth was not at the center of the universe

## Kepler's Laws

### Kepler's First Law

The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci

![Alt text](image-10.png)

One tack is the sun.

### Kepler's Second Law

A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time

![Alt text](image-8.png)

$$ A = B $$

### Kepler's Third Law

$$
P^2 \propto r^3
$$

The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit

![Alt text](image-5.png)

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{GM}{4\pi^2} & = \frac{d^3}{T^2} \\
\end{align*}
$$

So we know that ratio is a constant

### Newton's Version

$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_1 + M_2)}a^3
$$

- $P$ is the orbital period
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the two objects
- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit

## Gravity

$$
F = \frac{GM_1M_2}{R^2}
$$

### Orbital Velocity

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

- $v$ is the orbital velocity
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$)
- $M$ is the mass of the object being orbited
- $R$ is the distance between the two objects

### Escape Velocity

$$
v_{\text{escape}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

$$
L = mvr
$$

- $L$ is the angular momentum
- $m$ is the mass of the object
- $v$ is the velocity of the object

### Conservation of Energy

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
$$

## Important Numbers

- **Gravitational Constant ($G$)** : $6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$
- **Mass of the Earth** : $5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{kg}$
- **Mass of the Sun** : $1.989 \times 10^{30} \text{kg}$
- **Distance from the Earth to the Sun** : $1.496 \times 10^{11} \text{m}$ = 1 AU
- **Radius of the Earth** : $6.371 \times 10^{6} \text{m}$

## Light

### Wavelength ($\lambda$)

The distance between two peaks in a wave.

### Frequency ($f$)

The number of peaks that pass a point in a given time. Corresponds to the color of light and the energy of the light.

### Speed of Light ($c$)

$$
c = \lambda f \\
c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}
$$

### Energy of Light

$$
E = hf
$$

- $E$ is the energy of the light
- $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{J s}$)

### Spectra

The colors of light emitted by an object.

#### Continuous Spectra

![alt text](image-6.png)

Spans all visible wavelengths without interruption

#### Emission Line Spectra

![alt text](image-7.png)

Only emits light at specific wavelengths. Like a thin gas cloud.

#### Absorption Line Spectra

![alt text](image-9.png)

When something like a gas cloud absorbs light at specific wavelengths.

### Chemical Fingerprints

![alt text](image-11.png)

Each element has a unique set of energy levels and therefore a unique set of spectral lines.

By looking at the absorption or emission lines of a star, we can determine what elements are present in the star.

### Wein's Law

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
$$

- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the peak wavelength
- $b$ is Wien's displacement constant ($2.90 \times 10^{-3} \text{m K}$)

#### Blackbody Radiation

1. Hotter objects emit more light at all frequencies per unit area.
2. Hotter objects emit photons with a higher average energy.

### Doppler Effect

$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{c}
$$

- $\Delta \lambda$ is the change in wavelength
- $\lambda$ is the original wavelength
- $v$ is the velocity of the object
- $c$ is the speed of light

## Telescopes

### Light Collecting Area

The area of the primary mirror that collects light. Increases with the square of the diameter (alot more than our eyes)

### Angular Resolution

The smallest angle over which we can tell that two objects are distinct.

$$
\theta_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.22\lambda}{D}
$$

### Types of Telescopes

#### Refracting Telescopes

![alt text](image-13.png)

Uses lenses to focus light.

![alt text](image-14.png)

#### Reflecting Telescopes

![alt text](image-15.png)

Uses mirrors to focus light.

#### X-Ray Telescopes

![alt text](image-16.png)

Uses mirrors to focus x-rays.

### Why we send telescopes into space

- Light pollution
- Atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths
- Turbulence causes stars to twinkle. The temperature of the air changes the refractive index of the air.

## The Solar System

### Properties

- Large bodies in the solar system have orderly motions.
- Planetary orbits are nearly circular and lie nearly in the same plane.
- Most planets rotate in the same direction in which they orbit.
- Asteroids and comets are leftovers from the formation of the solar system.
- Exceptions: Rotation of Ur anus / Venus, Earth's large moon, etc.
- The solar system contains two types of planets:

#### Terrestrial Planets

- Dense
- Rocky
- Small
- Slow rotation

#### Jovian Planets

- Low density
- Gaseous
- Large
- Fast rotation

### Formation

#### Nebular Theory

1. **Collapse** - The cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity.
2. **Flattening** - The cloud flattens into a disk.
3. **Condensation** - The center of the disk becomes the sun and the rest of the disk forms the planets.
